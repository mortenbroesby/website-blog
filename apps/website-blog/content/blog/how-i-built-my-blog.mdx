### Introduction

When building this page, my biggest priority has been to find a solution that would leverage simplicity,
but also let me embed completely custom content in each blog post, should I want or need it.

When using markdown or a rich-text editor in a CMS, it's not at all clear how to do this.
You're generally limited to the handful of HTML elements that these tools can render to.

#### The stack

This blog is a Next.js application.

I chose Next.js as it provides a great developer experience with all the features i needed.
Hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more.

I deploy and host this blog on Vercel.

Their hosting approach is hassle-less, and comes with a basic CI built-in.

When it comes to the styling, I haven't yet fully decided.
It's currently a tie between Stitches, Emotion and extending Mantine's theming, which uses Emotion below the hood.

#### MDX to the rescue!

MDX is great. It allows me to write in Markdown, and seamlessly integrate JSX components.
It's an extension of Markdown that allows you to import and use custom React components.

Even if you've never written Markdown, you've probably seen it before.
It's a widely-used format â€” all those README.md files that are shown on Github repositories are Markdown!

For Metadata, I use frontmatter. It's a simple way to add metadata to markdown files.

To orchestrate fetching and rendering of MDX files, I [ContentLayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/).
Shoutout to ContentLayer for making file-based content generation so easy!

#### Using MDX with Next.js

On this blog, I currently use next-mdx-remote. I will probably switch to [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler)
in the near future, as it offers many of the benefits of next-mdx-remote, but without the "no import" drawback.

#### Component Framework

Currently undecided!

#### My future plans

The plan is to write here any time I learn something new, or when I want to share things.

Let's see how that goes ;-)
