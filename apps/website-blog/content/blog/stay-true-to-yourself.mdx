Last year I became a dad. This changed my life fundamentally.

I can now honestly say that I wasn't prepared for it. I was convinced I'd be able to balance my life, without
having to make a lot of changes. As time went on, my wife and I started getting less and less sleep.
Work started being affected. Hobbies had to be placed on hold.
After a while, we'd be floating through the weeks, and weekends would merely provide us with a short break from it all.

All of this was a result of my being a dad, and not being prepared to handle the changes that came with it.

So, I have made a big decision.

<b>I have decided to move back to Denmark</b>.

This was not an easy choice, as I've now lived in the Netherlands for over 5 years. 15% of my life until now.
My whole life is here; My friend group, my professional network and the foundation of my day-to-day life.

This is a scary decision — and it might not be right one — but I'm already happy that I made it.

We'll be closer to family, - and we have agreed to also buy fundamental things that we've been holding off on, like a car, and -- a house.

I truly believe that this will change our little family's life for the better. And I'm ready to make it happen.
