# TODO

- Migrate `Uses` page
- Migrate `public` folder with icons, etc.

- Truly consider what page layout I want

  - Needs to have a nice font
  - Needs to have a layout suitable for blog posts
  - Example: https://leerob.io/blog/community-messaging-fit

- Setup dedicated components
  - Take some inspiration from https://github.com/shadcn/taxonomy
  - Utilise libraries where possible
    - https://ark-ui.com/

# Nice to haves

- Dashboard Area - https://github.com/matt765/daydash
- Github Auth - look at https://github.com/shadcn/taxonomy
- Possibly migrate https://mortenbroesby.github.io/tree-online/
