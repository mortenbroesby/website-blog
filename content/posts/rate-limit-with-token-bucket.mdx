This week I was faced with a challenge.

*How do we predict how many users will access our website?*

Most Software-as-a-Service (SAAS) providers have features in place that prevents overloading their service, for example by limiting the number of requests that can be made.
This, in turn, limits how many users can use the services on consuming websites with pages taht use such a SAAS products.

Take for example payments. At any given second, no more than 100 users will be able to pay. This is a rate limit.

In our above situation, the 101'st user who shows up will be blocked. That's objectively a terrible user experience.

One common way to minimise the risk users hitting the rate limit, is to implement a *Token Bucket* strategy.

### Token Bucket

A token bucket is an algorithm that allows tokens to be accumulated over time at a specific rate.
These tokens can then be “redeemed” to execute some action, or retrieve a payload. If there are no tokens available, the action cannot be taken.

Imagine that we have a bucket that holds some number of balls, say 100.

When there are fewer than 100 balls in the bucket, a machine will automatically refill the bucket
at a rate of 1 ball per second until it is full again. We can take as many balls as we want as
quickly as we want, but once the bucket is empty, we have to wait for it to start filling up again
before we can take more.

#### Javascript Code Example

Below is a simple implementation of a Token Bucket.

<EditableCode
  language="typescript"
  code={`
class TokenBucket {
  constructor(capacity: number, fillPerSecond: number) {
    this.capacity = capacity;
    this.fillPerSecond = fillPerSecond;

    this.lastFilled = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
    this.tokens = capacity;
  }

  take() {
    this.refill();

    if (this.tokens > 0) {
      this.tokens -= 1;
      return true;
    }

    return false;
  }

  refill() {
    const now = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
    const rate = (now - this.lastFilled) / this.fillPerSecond;

    this.tokens = Math.min(this.capacity, this.tokens + Math.floor(rate * this.capacity));
    this.lastFilled = now;
  }
}
`}
/>

<br />

If we implement the Token Bucket strategy to rate limit an API, then it allows us to set a request rate, i.e. the rate at which tokens are added to the bucket,
with the ability to burst above this rate for a short period, until we have drained the capacity of the bucket.

The implementation can of course be tweaked to automatically re-fill at set times or intervals as well, depending on our needs.

In any case, by using this Token Bucket strategy, we are able to pre-fill a bucket of requests that stays below the rate-limit
of a previously mentioned SAAS product.

The user are able to use our website just like they were before, and once our bucket is empty, we just fall back to the normal API call.
